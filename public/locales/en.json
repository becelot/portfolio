The framework enables developers to implement the well-known AST datastructure in the form of web components, while simultaneously allowing to specify, how users can interact with them. This information is aggregated by the framework, allowing end-users to create models for the DSL visually, rather than relying on the user to learn the abstract syntax of a programming language."
